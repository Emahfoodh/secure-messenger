Before we start with Phase 1, I need to understand your current setup:

1. Do you have React Native Expo CLI installed and a Firebase project ready?
2. Are you planning to use Firebase for backend services, or do you have any preference for the backend?
3. What's your experience level with React Native and Firebase?

Let me know your answers, and we'll begin with Phase 1 setup!
