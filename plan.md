Great! I'll help you create a secure messaging app with React Native Expo. Let me break this down into manageable phases for better planning and implementation.

## Project Plan: Secure Messaging App (React Native Expo)

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Authentication Foundation**
- Set up React Native Expo project
- Configure Firebase project and SDK
- Implement basic navigation structure
- Create authentication screens (Login/Signup)
- Set up Firebase Authentication
- Implement biometric authentication setup
- Basic error handling framework

### **Phase 2: User Profile & Security Infrastructure**
- User profile creation and management
- Profile picture upload functionality
- Set up encryption foundation for end-to-end messaging
- Implement secure storage for sensitive data
- User search functionality
- QR code generation for user profiles

### **Phase 3: Core Messaging Features**
- Basic text messaging implementation
- Real-time message synchronization
- Message status indicators (sent, delivered, read)
- Typing indicators
- Contact management (add/remove contacts)
- Message edit/delete functionality

### **Phase 4: Media & Enhanced Messaging**
- Image sharing implementation
- Video sharing implementation
- Media compression and optimization
- Message encryption for regular chats
- File storage and retrieval system

### **Phase 5: Secret Chats & End-to-End Encryption**
- Implement end-to-end encryption protocol
- Secret chat creation and management
- Key exchange mechanisms

### **Phase 6: Advanced Features (Bonus)**
- Group messaging functionality
- Push notifications setup
- Advanced error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Additional security features

### **Phase 7: Polish & Documentation**
- UI/UX improvements
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation creation
- User guides
- Final security audit

## for wnd to end encryption
Let me help you understand what we need to implement true end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for secret chats. Looking at your current code, I see that while you have the structure for secret chats, the actual encryption implementation needs to be enhanced. Here's what we need to do:

1. **Key Generation and Exchange**
   - Each user needs to generate their own public/private key pair when they first sign up
   - Users need to exchange their public keys securely when starting a secret chat
   - Generate a unique session key for each secret chat

2. **Message Encryption**
   - Encrypt message content on the sender's device before sending
   - Include text messages, images, videos, and any other media
   - Messages should only be decryptable by the intended recipient

3. **Key Storage and Management**
   - Securely store private keys on user's device (never send to server)
   - Implement key rotation for better security
   - Handle key backup/recovery scenarios

4. **Verification System**
   - Add a way for users to verify each other's identity
   - Could use QR codes or security codes that both parties can compare
   - Show security indicators in the UI to confirm encryption status

5. **Security Features**
   - Implement message expiration for secret chats
   - Add screenshot detection/prevention
   - Enable message deletion on both sides
   - Prevent message forwarding in secret chats

6. **Client-Side Processing**
   - All encryption/decryption must happen on the device
   - Server should never have access to decryption keys
   - Implement proper error handling for failed encryption/decryption

Would you like me to explain any of these points in more detail before we move on to implementation? Also, we should decide which encryption algorithms and libraries would be best suited for your mobile app's needs.
